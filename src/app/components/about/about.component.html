      <p>
        I specialize in building fullstack solutions using <strong>Angular, Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL</strong>.
        I enjoy turning ideas into reality through code, and I’m always hungry to learn and improve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond code, I’m also into UI/UX design, making sure every app not only works great but looks clean and modern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's collaborating with teams, solving bugs, or exploring new tech stacks — I bring solid vibes and clean solutions 💻✨.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started my journey in web dev a few months ago and quickly fell in love with building sleek, functional apps. 
        From backend logic to frontend vibes — I love crafting full experiences.

      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I debug with snacks — if it’s not working, I eat a cookie 🍪 and try again.</p>
      <p>Let’s connect and build something awesome together!</p>
